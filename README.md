# Boring nasa news 🗞️ 

It's a boring (not really) space knowledge and kinda news app using nasa api 

## Getting Started 🤌

So like the home page is where you will find 6 random but intersting facts about space and planets 🌍

And then there is cms(Coronal Mass Ejection) update where you will find  around 20 depending on your date 📅 

And then there is mara weather page where you will get mars weather update currently it's showing only 2020's thing's idk why but I will fix that 

Thanks
